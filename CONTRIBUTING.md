# How to contribute

Make a PR with the contributions you want to make 

Here are some important resources:

**TODO**

## Testing

Right now only pytest is used for the python scripts

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to this repo](https://github.com/1000plus900plus40plus8/darknet-resources/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).  We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."


Thanks,
